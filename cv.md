## About Myself

I go to RSSchool for up my skills. I relocated to America because I won a green card. When I came to America my English was basic level and I couldn't find a normal job. Now my English better but I lost some my skills and I need know new trends in Web Programming.

My strengths are focus on result, diligence and sociability.  
I worked in one web company, they do SEO optimization but they didn't have a full stack programmer. Sometimes the company created a new websites for clients business. My job was to create a website for business or fix mistakes on their websites.
Some my projects you can see on the links:

- _[Furniture Store](https://superstore.by/)_
